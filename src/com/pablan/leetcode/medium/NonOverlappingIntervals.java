     * Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
     * Output: 1
     * Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
