    /**
     * Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.
     *
     * The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: "abc"
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
     *
     * Input: "aaa"
     * Output: 6
     * Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
     *
     * Pablo's notes: - For naive approach (at least something, start expanding at each center and you will find
     * all palindromes, but in O(n^2))
     * For linear time, you will have to use Manacher's algorithm
     *
